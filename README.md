jsdrink is a simple parser combinators library written in TypeScript, ported from [cordx56/godrink](https://github.com/cordx56/godrink).

## Feature
jsdrink is a simple, lightweight library.
jsdrink does not depend on non-standard libraries except dev-dependencies.

jsdrink reads input bytes or string and applies parsers in sequence and parses them into the desired structures.
